TODO: Title to be remade

* humans have cognitive ability to sense through objects and make them extension of their own sensation
  * e.g. you can sense things through the stick
* the more we train that kind of sensation, it makes sense that we get more neural connections for that function and given object becomes more part of our body
  * referring to previous example: blind people probably sense way batter through stick then e.g. me
* Those realizations seem like very nice explanation for multiple of phenomena in lifes of (wo)man in chastity:
  * sensing through cage
  * feeling cage like part of ourselves, our body
  * therefore feeling unnatural, missing, bad discomfort and disorientation when missing cage
  * sensing through strapon when fucking

Regarding last point, the more I fuck with strapon the more I feel through strapon of pussy/ass I fuck, like I would put my penis inside. As same time, I feel this pleasure coming from swinging cage (covered in post: TODO link to post about retraining for nipple gasm and anal gasm)
