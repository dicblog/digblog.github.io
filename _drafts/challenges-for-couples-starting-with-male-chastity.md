Same challenges for newbies:

(for now just drafts notes to put later in to better words)

Time / Management / Cost:

* He may need more teasing and attention and play that normally used to and even expect
* Lack of this play may have very negative strong impact that may require later long term fixing
* She may underestimate amount of maintenance that male in chastity requires
* She may underestimate how much time and effort she will need to put in first month or quarter to : 
  * organize all items (sexy clothes, toys, therefore develop system so it's efficient to put them after session and before session)
  * figure out schedule how to fit things with other in their lives, (e.g. unexpected things happen, bad mood, health issues, etc. while male require maintenance and teasing and positive reinforcement for neural rewiring to be effective)
  * learning how to do things:
    * how to put cage - both partners have to learn/train . He how to effectively calm down and get limp. She how to effectively put it on.
    * tease him, combine stimuli etc...
* Not mentioning changing cages, etc. and other extra costs and time related with required items, maybe new clothes (even more loose daily trousers) etc.
* Time of running journal/log (both partners), calendar. - IMHO very important and helpful.
* Time for managing videos and photos from sessions and attaching them to logs, journals.
